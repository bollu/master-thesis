The MS Word templates from University of Calgary is given here.
These are NOT directly usable at IIIT, Hyderabad. I request
a student who wishes to write a thesis using MS Word at IIIT-H
to look at the sampleThesis.pdf in the LaTeX directory.
Please create a MS Word template and a sample file that conforms
to the format given there.

After you do so, PLEASE SHARE THE SAME with the academic office
and Dean (R&D) so that future students can benefit from your efforts.
