@article{tversky1977features,
  abstract = {Questions the metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric representation of similarity on both theoretical and empirical grounds. A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.

@misc{goldberg2014word2vec,
  abstract = {The word2vec software of Tomas Mikolov and colleagues
(https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ ) has gained a lot of traction lately, and
provides state-of-the-art word embeddings. The learning models behind the
software are described in two research papers. We found the description of the
models in these papers to be somewhat cryptic and hard to follow. While the
motivations and presentation may be obvious to the neural-networks
language-modeling crowd, we had to struggle quite a bit to figure out the
rationale behind the equations.
  This note is an attempt to explain equation (4) (negative sampling) in
"Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality"
