%% LGrind is used to format source code of different programming
%% languages for LaTeX.
%% 
%% LGrind is a major adaptation of Jerry Leichter's tgrind for LaTeX,
%% which was a notable improvement upon Van Jacobsen's tgrind for
%% plain TeX, which was adapted from vgrind, a troff prettyprinter.
%% 
%% Author: Michael Piefel, lgrind@gmx.net
%% Based on Van Jacobson's ``tgrindmac'', a macro package for TeX.
%% Modified, 1987 by Jerry Leichter. Put '@' in all internal names.
%% Modified, 1991 by George Reilly. Changed name from tgrind to lgrind.
%% Modified, 1995 by Michael Piefel. Made it work with \LaTeXe.
%%          -1999    Hundreds of bells and whistles. No changelog here.
